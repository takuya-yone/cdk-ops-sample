# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive testing framework and infrastructure to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability across the application. The testing system will support multiple testing types including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, with automated test execution and reporting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run unit tests for individual components, so that I can verify that each piece of code works correctly in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer executes unit tests THEN the system SHALL run all unit test files and display results
2. WHEN a unit test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and stack traces
3. WHEN unit tests pass THEN the system SHALL display a success summary with test count and execution time
4. IF a test file is modified THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and re-run affected tests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run integration tests, so that I can verify that different components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN the system SHALL test interactions between multiple components
2. WHEN database connections are required THEN the system SHALL use test databases or mocks
3. WHEN external services are involved THEN the system SHALL use appropriate test doubles or sandbox environments
4. IF integration tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about which component interactions failed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test coverage reporting, so that I can identify untested code areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL generate code coverage reports
2. WHEN coverage falls below a threshold THEN the system SHALL flag low coverage areas
3. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL display line-by-line coverage information
4. IF new code is added without tests THEN the system SHALL highlight uncovered lines

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run tests in different environments, so that I can ensure compatibility across development, staging, and production-like conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run in different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific configurations
2. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL load appropriate test environment settings
3. WHEN tests require different data sets THEN the system SHALL use environment-appropriate test data
4. IF environment setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about missing dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want continuous integration test execution, so that tests run automatically on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger test execution
2. WHEN tests fail in CI THEN the system SHALL prevent code merging and notify developers
3. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL allow code integration and deployment
4. IF CI test execution times out THEN the system SHALL fail the build and provide timeout information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test data management utilities, so that I can easily set up and tear down test scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need data setup THEN the system SHALL provide fixtures and factory functions
2. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up test data automatically
3. WHEN multiple tests need similar data THEN the system SHALL allow shared test fixtures
4. IF test data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL isolate test data between test runs
